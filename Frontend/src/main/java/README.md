To run the Java application from the command line, you'll need to compile the code into a .class file and then execute it using the Java Runtime Environment. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Compile the Java Code: Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved CancerStatisticApp.java. Then, compile the Java file using the javac command. You need to have the JDK installed for this step.

        javac CancerStatisticApp.java

    This command will compile the Java code and generate a CancerStatisticApp.class file in the same directory.


2. Run the Application: After compiling the code, you can run the application using the java command:

        java CancerStatisticApp

3. Including MySQL JDBC Driver: To ensure that the Java application can communicate with the MySQL database, the MySQL JDBC Driver (Connector/J) needs to be in the classpath. If it's not in the classpath, you'll encounter a ClassNotFoundException. You can include it in the classpath using the -cp or --classpath option:

        java -cp .:mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar CancerStatisticApp

    Replace mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar with the actual name of your JDBC driver file. On Windows, use a semicolon (;) instead of a colon (:) to separate classpath entries.

Additional Notes:
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure that both Java Development Kit (JDK) and MySQL are correctly installed and configured on your system.
- **JDBC Driver**: The MySQL JDBC driver (mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar) must be downloaded and available on your system. You can download it from the MySQL official website or use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.
- **File Paths**: In the classpath, use the correct file paths to the .class file and JDBC driver. The current directory is represented by '.'

Once you've set up everything correctly, you can run the Java application from the command line and interact with the MySQL database as specified in the program.
